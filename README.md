# sHiTTP

**sHiTTP** is a small minimal HTTP/1.1 server written from scratch in C. This project is mostly educational.  

The codebase is currently a bit messy and contains prototyping work, which will be cleaned up later. 



## TODO

- [ ] Fully implement the parser (method, path, version, headers, body)  
- [ ] Add request/response handling  
- [ ] Add support for chunked transfer encoding  
- [ ] Implement routing based on request paths  
- [ ] Add concurrency to handle multiple requests simultaneously  
- [ ] Support persistent connections (`Keep-Alive`)  
- [ ] Add HTTP/1.0 support  
- [ ] Enforce stricter security and semantic rules
